<p1-1>
    <strong>Horizon</strong> is a digital project that examines the cultural contexts of the countries I’ve lived in, weaving together personal memory with broader reflections on identity and belonging. Rooted in lived experience, it explores how moving across borders shaped my understanding of self and place.<br><br>
  
    Through interactive HTML and CSS design, <strong>Horizon</strong> functions as both an autobiographical archive and a visual study of migration, cultural hybridity, and adaptation. It encourages viewers to consider how identity is continuously negotiated across geographies, and how personal stories can reflect larger global dynamics.<br><br>
  
    By engaging with this project, I hope others gain insight into the complexities of cultural transition—and perhaps see parts of their own journeys reflected within it.
