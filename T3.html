<h1-4> BECOMING</h1-3>
<p1-4>Right now, I’m in a space of in-between —</strong>  
  not lost, but not entirely found either.  
  Living in Lisbon has cracked something open in me.  
  It’s not just another stop;  
  it’s a mirror, a container, a quiet confrontation.  
  I wake up every day unsure of what version of myself I’ll meet,  
  and for once, I’m okay with that.  
  There’s something about the pace here —  
  the light, the way the city breathes —  
  that encourages exploration not just of place,  
  but of self.Right now, I’m in a space of in-between —</strong>

  Maybe I’m made of transitions.  
  Of hyphens.  
  Of migrations — both internal and external.  
  Lisbon is showing me that identity isn’t something you lock in —  
  it’s something you tune into.  
  It hums differently in every place you land.  Now, I’m realizing there is no singular “me” to arrive at.
